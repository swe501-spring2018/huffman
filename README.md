# huffman

Project:

Huffman coding.

. Read an input file
. Analyze the file to create an Huffman code for N=3 characters
. Compress the file using your code
. Save the code as a .htab file (your custom format)
. Save the compressed file as a binary .hzip file (the encoder)
. Read the code from .htab file 
. Save the reconstructed code decoded from the .hzip file (the decoder)

You are encouraged to use the STL data structures and algorithms.
